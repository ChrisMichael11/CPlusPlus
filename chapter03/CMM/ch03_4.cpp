//  Write a program to report the length of the longest and shortest string in its input.

/* Create two variables of type string::size_type: one to hold the shortest size, and one 
to hold the longest size. As the program proceeds through the input loop it first checks 
to see if shortest_size has been assigned a value other than zero. If not, it assigns it 
the first stringâ€™s size; otherwise it checks to see if the current string is shortest than
 shortest_size. It then checks to see if the current string is longer than longest_size.*/
